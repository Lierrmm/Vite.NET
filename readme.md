# Vite.NET

Vite.NET is a library that allows you to easily implement Vite integrations in your ASP.NET Core Razor Pages and MVC applications.

This offers great advantages in the simplification of SPA authorization integration, allowing the implementation of micro front ends outside of a node ecosystem and in general just giving you more tools and tradeoffs when you're building applications.

The main idea is to bridge the gap between the backend and the front end and allow better integration between the two.
